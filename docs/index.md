# Hypixel Tool Documentation

Welcome to `hypixel-tools`, useful and handy tools based on [Hypixel API](https://api.hypixel.net/), written in Python.

Currently the project is under development. A demo version should be released soon, with some simple functions based directly on the API.

## Building

You'll need a Python environment with `mkdocs` to build the project. For a full list of packages required, please refer to [requirements.txt](reqirements.txt)
